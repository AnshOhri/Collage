    <p class="mainpara">
      This is my first project in web development and it was given to me by <a href="https://shrutiaroraa.github.io/cv/">Ms.Shruti Arora</a>.
      I made a collage in heart shape using table in html. I did some
      basic designing using my basic css knowledge. I used 46 images in this Collage.
      It was a great experience to make this website. It tested all my basic knowledge of html and css
      and gave me some confidence.
